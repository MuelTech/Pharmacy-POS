# Low Stock Alerts Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds visual low stock alerts to the Pharmacy POS system, providing real-time warnings when product stock falls below their reorder levels.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Trigger Condition
- **Primary Logic**: Stock is considered low when `current_stock <= reorder_level`
- **Fallback Logic**: If no reorder_level is set (0 or null), stock is considered low when `current_stock <= 10`

### 2. Visual Alerts

#### StaffDashboard.jsx
- **Product Name**: Turns red when stock is low
- **Stock Display**: Changes color based on stock level + shows warning icon (⚠️)
- **Tooltip**: Provides detailed stock information on hover

#### Products.jsx (Modal)
- **Product Name**: Turns red when stock is low
- **Stock Column**: Shows color-coded stock levels + warning icon (⚠️)
- **Tooltip**: Provides detailed stock information and reorder recommendations

### 3. Color Coding System
- **🔴 Red (#dc2626)**: Low stock (at or below reorder level)
- **🟠 Orange (#d97706)**: Medium stock (20-50 units)
- **🟢 Green (#059669)**: Good stock (50+ units)

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Alerts update automatically when stock changes after transactions
- Uses existing product reload mechanisms for data freshness

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
Updated `backend/routes/products.js` to include `reorder_level` in API responses:
- Added `reorder_level` to staff_priority query
- Added `reorder_level` to staff_view query

### Frontend Changes

#### New Utility File: `frontend/src/utils/stockUtils.js`
Provides centralized functions for:
- `isLowStock(currentStock, reorderLevel)` - Check if stock is low
- `getStockColor(currentStock, reorderLevel)` - Get appropriate color
- `getLowStockIcon(currentStock, reorderLevel)` - Get warning icon
- `getStockTooltip(currentStock, reorderLevel)` - Get tooltip text

#### Updated Components:
1. **StaffDashboard.jsx**
   - Imports stock utility functions
   - Applies low stock styling to product names and stock displays
   - Shows warning icons and tooltips

2. **Products.jsx**
   - Imports stock utility functions
   - Applies low stock styling to product names and stock columns
   - Shows warning icons and tooltips

#### Enhanced CSS:

- **Products.css**: Added low-stock-alert classes with pulse animation

## Usage Examples

### Example Scenarios:

1. **Product with Reorder Level Set**
   - Current Stock: 5, Reorder Level: 10
   - **Result**: Shows as low stock (red with ⚠️)
   - **Tooltip**: "Low stock! Current: 5, Reorder level: 10. Please reorder soon."

2. **Product without Reorder Level**
   - Current Stock: 8, Reorder Level: 0
   - **Result**: Shows as low stock (red with ⚠️)
   - **Tooltip**: "Low stock! Current: 8. Please reorder soon."

3. **Product with Good Stock**
   - Current Stock: 100, Reorder Level: 20
   - **Result**: Shows as normal stock (green)
   - **Tooltip**: "Stock level: 100, Reorder at: 20"

## Animation Effects
- **Pulse Animation**: Low stock items pulse gently to draw attention
- **Color Transitions**: Smooth color transitions when stock levels change
- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced tooltips provide detailed information

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Set reorder levels for products in the Admin inventory management
2. Create orders that reduce stock below reorder levels
3. Observe visual changes in both StaffDashboard and Products modal
4. Hover over stock displays to see tooltips

## Future Enhancements
- Email/SMS notifications for low stock
- Dashboard summary of all low stock items
- Automatic purchase order generation
- Low stock reporting and analytics
